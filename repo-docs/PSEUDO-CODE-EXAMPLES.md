# Obs Disp - Pseudo Code Examples

Here are a few examples of architectures/ways to use `obs-disp`. With and without additional libraries.

More importantly: the following examples demonstrate how to make use of and work with *other* libraries
and utilities but still use `obs-disp` as a top-level abstraction for clean coding. 

Hopefully this will give you better idea for the usecases of the lib.

Types of examples:
- `obs-disp` on its own
- `obs-disp` wrapping another library
- `obs-disp` in a way to create a library on its own (usable in other `obs-disp` projects)
